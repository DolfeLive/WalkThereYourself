# WalkThereYourself

Ever feel like you have too much time on your hands? Ever feel like the game isn't realistic enough? Want to spend 20 hours walking to The Great Bulwark?
Well I have the solution to some of those problems!
Walk There Yourself is a mod that lets (forces) you to have to walk the great treck from the cabin all the way to The Great Bulwark, no running, no jumping or anything to entertain yourself with!
